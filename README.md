# RFP Accelerator
The goal of this Accelerator is to provide an API that allows various operations to be performed against RFPs.  The API leverages Python FastAPI for the backend and a Blazor Server App for the UI.  The API has a Swagger UI which can be accessed when running locally by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000.  The APIs can be testing directly from the Swagger Page so no need from PostMan or actually using the UI.

## Some operations do require you you call some of the various APIs in a specific order, which we will document here
